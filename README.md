# SpaceFreighter
My first game built on Scratch. You're hired as a space freighter to haul rare cargo from the moon to the planet and back. What could go wrong? 

In my Scratch project you'll find yourself hired as a space freighter to haul rare cargo from the moon to the planet and back, avoiding asteroids and pirates in hopes of turning a profit. 

Press W to move forward, A and D to turn, and S to backup. Q to boost and SPACE to fire. 

Co-pilots can press the arrow keys, Up to move forward, Left and Right to turn, and down to backup. 0 on the Num-pad to shoot.

I made the project with my three children in mind, the special sound effects by my two co-pilots, my two and three-year-old boys. The duplicate controls allow you to play with your child aka "co-pilot".

The freighter ship is represented by the long, red ship with the hole in the middle for cargo. The red circle in the top left represents the moon, and the blue and green circle in the bottom right is the planet. The green and purple squares represent the cargo, and they are deposited on their color corresponding pads on the planet and moon. Simply touch the cargo with the ship to pick it up. Asteroids separate the planet from the moon and there have been some reports of pirates in the verse preying on wealthy traders, represented by the small blue ships.
